<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.


	This homework was very interesting. In part 1 I coded a mass spring system to simulate the cloth through filling the given spring nad mass vector3d lists. In the second part I simulated via numerical intergration movement of these point masses which I followed up with figuring out how to handle collisions with spheres, planes and the cloth itself.
	Overall it was very interesting to see the different parts that would go into something as simple as rendering a cloth and exerting forces on it in a 3-D region with other objects or planes.

Varying the spring constant between the base of 5000, 100 and 100000 showed how the cloth was a lot more rigid and bouncy at higher spring constants wheras at low constants the cloth was more flexible and settled a lot faster after dropping

The density mostly affected the top edge as expected, with higher density i.e. 500, the middle of the top edge drooped more as expected due to a larger gravity force acting on it wheras at how gravity the top edge was nearly straight as shwon in images below

Varying damping changes how much the cloth moves as it falls, with damping at 0% it appears the cloth will bounce around for a long time (possible indefinite??) and changing damping to 100% will just cause it to smmothly float to its final resting position with no back and forth oscilation

	It appears that the cloth is more rigid and "sticks out" a lot more at higher constant values. As shown in the screenshots below, ks = 500 appears to be the most contoured to the sphere underneath wheras ks = 50000 has a very wide appearence with many parts of the cloth sticking out weirdly

	As expected, increasing the density will cause the cloth to fold more tightly and closer to the ground. The density 1 screenshot shows the cloth resting folded over itself relatively off the plane wheras the density 5000 screenshot shows hte cloth splat on the plane

	Low spring constant appears to cause the cloth to curl around itself and wrap around in a compact manner but in a different way to high density.
	High spring constant seems to cause the cloth to become a lot more fluid and appears a lot more "relaxed"

A shader program is a program that runs on the GPU and is used to render graphics. It is a program that is used to determine how the pixels on the screen should be colored.
Vertex and fragment shaders work together to render graphics. The vertex shader is used to determine the position of the vertices of the object being rendered from 3D to 2D. The fragment shader is used to determine the color of the pixels on the screen.
